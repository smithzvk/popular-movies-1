Popular Movies
========

This is a simple Android app for displaying information about popular movies.
This uses The Movie Database as a data source.  In order for this to work, you
must obtain and use your own API key for that API.

Use the file `private.xml.tmpl` as a template for a resource file that will hold
your API key.  Insert it there and copy that file to
`app/src/main/res/values/private.xml` directory.
